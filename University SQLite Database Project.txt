~ University SQLite Database Project

Welcome to the University SQLite Database Project. This repository contains a comprehensive SQLite database representing a University's operations, along with various SQL queries and processes applied to this data.

~ Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. Hotel Management System Database (SQL file): This is the core of our project. It contains various tables representing different aspects of a hotel's operations, such as Rooms, Guests, Bookings, Staff, Services, etc.

2. SQL Queries: A collection of SQL scripts used to manipulate and analyze the data in the University database. These scripts demonstrate various SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, and more.

~ Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the SQLite file in your preferred SQLite browser. You can then run the SQL scripts to see them in action.
